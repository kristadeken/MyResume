  I spent most of my childhood caring for my family. By the time I turned 20, I had dedicated those years to helping my mom take care of my autistic sister. 
While other kids were going through their rebellious teenage phase or dating, I was taking on the role of a caregiver. I went to school with my sister, sat
in the same classrooms, and helped her with everything—bathing, homework, and navigating life. 
I was a parent at a young age, but I didn’t mind because I loved being there for my mom and sister.

  When I was in my early 20s, my mom was starting to get Pick’s disease, it is a devastating and rare form of dementia.  Unbeknownst to me for many years though,
I stayed with her and became her caregiver, watching her slowly slip away. She passed away on February 16th, 2019. Losing her felt like losing my entire
world—she was all I had left. I had no money, no car, no family, and was on the verge of being homeless. No one would hire me because my only recent work 
experience was 24/7 caregiving.

  I walked for miles in the snow to interviews, only to be turned down time and time again. I didn’t have time to mourn my mom—I needed to find work. 
Catholic Charities stepped in and covered my rent for a month. The archdiocese even offered food, but I told them, “This is all I need to survive, 
I have a roof over my head for a month now.” I refused to give up. I told myself, “Not today, Satan!” and kept pushing forward.

  Eventually, I found a job at a temp medical staffing agency. Every day, I biked, walked, and took the bus for three hours just to get there.
Despite everything, I felt thankful just to be alive. I had come to terms with the fact that I’d likely spend the rest of my life alone, and I was okay
with that because I had survived. 

  Then I met my Rob at this job and we have been together ever since. He encouraged me to go back and finish my Computer Science Bachelor degree in 2021. 
We were married June 30, 2024 this year.
