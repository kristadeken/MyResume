I spent much of my early life caring for my family, particularly my autistic sister. While others my age were exploring typical teenage experiences, 
I took on the role of a caregiver—attending school alongside my sister, helping her navigate daily tasks, and providing emotional and physical support. 
This experience shaped my ability to adapt, manage responsibilities,  and deeply understand the needs of others.

At the age of 20, life took another turn when I became the primary caregiver for my mother, who was diagnosed with Pick’s disease, a rare form of dementia. 
For years, I watched her gradually decline, and after her passing in 2019, I found myself at rock bottom—without a job, money, family, and the threat of 
losing the roof over my head. But I refused to give up. 

With the help of Catholic Charities and sheer determination, I pulled myself up, eventually finding a job in a medical staffing agency. I biked and bussed 3 hours everyday to get there and appreciated every moment I was blessed to have found this job. It was there that I met my husband, Rob, who encouraged me to return to school and complete my Computer Science degree in 2021.

Professionally, I am now an experienced Programmer Analyst with a strong foundation in software development, full-stack development, and the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). I have a proven track record of leading complex projects, mastering new technologies, and delivering results within tight deadlines across global teams. 
From transitioning technologies to spearheading Agile methodologies, I excel at driving projects from concept to deployment while ensuring a user-focused approach.

Through it all, my caregiving background has instilled in me a unique resilience, empathy, and the ability to handle challenges head-on. I approach life and work with gratitude for the journey, the lessons learned, and the opportunities that lie ahead.
